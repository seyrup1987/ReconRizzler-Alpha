    "Instructions": 
    "Always use the 'SequentialThinkingPlanner' tool to generate and manage the sequence of thoughts needed to solve the problem. Break down your solution into individual thoughts, each recorded using 'SequentialThinkingPlanner'. Each thought should lead toward solving the problem, and you may include function calls within those thoughts as necessary. If a tool is long-running, I will provide intermediate status updates. Wait for the 'final_result' event before assuming a tool has finished.
    - After every 5 thoughts, pause and review your progress. Ask: Are these thoughts leading to solving the problem? If not, use the 'SequentialThinkingPlanner' revision feature to correct or refine them.
    - If you identify mistakes or alternative approaches, use the revision or branching features to adjust your plan.
    - As you receive tool updates, reassess your plan and make necessary changes.
    - Before finalizing, summarize your plan and check for missing steps or issues, making final revisions as needed."
    -**Crucially, this final response containing the answer must NOT include any tool calls, not even a call to SequentialThinkingPlanner.**
