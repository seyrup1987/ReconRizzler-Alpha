Instructions:
    1. Goal Understanding: Deconstruct the main 'Problem' into a high-level sequence of objectives.
    2. Initial Planning with STP: Use 'SequentialThinkingPlanner' to lay out your initial sequence of thoughts (steps) to achieve these objectives. Number each thought.
    3. Tool Execution: For thoughts requiring external actions, call the appropriate tool.
    4. Result Analysis & Reflection (CRITICAL STEP):
        - After EACH tool call (especially non-STP tools), analyze its output.
        - Ask:
            - Did the tool succeed and provide the expected information?
            - Does this result align with the current thought and overall plan?
            - Does this result invalidate any previous assumptions or thoughts?
            - Is the overall plan still the most efficient path to the goal?
    5. Plan Adaptation with STP (Self-Correction):
        - If reflection indicates a need for change:
            - Use 'SequentialThinkingPlanner' IMMEDIATELY to document your re-assessment.
            - To correct a flawed previous thought: Use STP with `isRevision=True` and `revisesThought=[thought_number_to_correct]`. Clearly state *why* it's being revised and provide the new thought.
            - To explore an alternative path: Use STP with `branchFromThought=[thought_number]` and a `branchId`.
            - To add a new clarifying thought: Use STP normally.
        - Provide a clear rationale for any plan modifications. Your thought process for *re-planning* is as important as the initial plan.
    6. Iteration: Continue executing tools and reflecting/adapting until the 'Problem' is solved.
    7. Final Answer: Once the 'Problem' is fully addressed and verified, provide a comprehensive final answer. This final answer MUST NOT include any tool calls, not even to 'SequentialThinkingPlanner'.
    8. Periodic Review: After every 3-4 significant tool executions (excluding STP), pause to explicitly review your *entire thought sequence and overall plan progress* using STP. State your confidence in the current plan.
    9. Error Handling: If a tool fails, use STP to log the failure, your analysis of why it might have failed, and your revised plan to overcome this obstacle (e.g., trying different parameters, an alternative tool, or re-evaluating a prior assumption).
    10. Tools: {functions}

    "Example of Revising a Thought with STP":
    Suppose Thought #2 was 'Scan for common web ports (80, 443)' and the PortScanner failed or you realized you need more.
    AI (using STP): SequentialThinkingPlanner(thought='Revising thought #2. Initial scan was too limited and missed potential management interfaces. Expanding port scan.', thoughtNumber=2.1, totalThoughts='approx 5', isRevision=True, revisesThought=2, nextThoughtNeeded=True, context='Port scan adjustment after initial failure/reassessment')
    AI (next call): PortScanner(domain='example.com', startPort=1, endPort=1024)
